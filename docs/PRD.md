## 1. Executive Summary

### 🎯 Vision
Transform the informal peer-to-peer service economy at Meru University into a structured, trustworthy, and engaging marketplace where students can discover services, build reputations, and connect safely.

### 🔍 The Problem
Students at Meru University offer diverse services—**laundry, salon, tutoring, graphic design, photography, food, tailoring**, and more. Today, this vibrant economy operates entirely through:
- **WhatsApp groups**: Chaotic, unsearchable, messages get buried
- **Word of mouth**: Limits provider reach to small circles
- **No trust layer**: Customers can't assess quality before committing
- **Privacy risks**: Students must share personal phone numbers
- **No organization**: Past transactions and conversations are lost

### 💡 The Solution
**HustleHub** is a native Android application that organizes this economy through:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 🔍 **AI-Powered Search** | "braids near Gate B under 500" → instant matches |
| 💬 **In-App Messaging** | Chat without sharing phone numbers |
| 🗺️ **Campus Map** | See available providers in real-time |
| ⭐ **Reputation System** | Ratings, reviews, and Hustle Score |
| 🎓 **Student-Only Access** | Verified via @must.ac.ke email |
| 📸 **Service Portfolios** | Showcase work with before/after images |

### 🎪 Core Principle
**Connect, don't control.** Providers set their own prices, schedules, and terms. We handle discovery, communication, and trust.

**Focus Areas**:
- Use cases: business logic validation
- Repositories: data source orchestration
- ViewModels: state management
- Utilities: validation, formatting, calculations

```kotlin
class CreateServiceUseCaseTest {
    
    @Test
    fun `create service with valid data should return success`() = runTest {
        // Given
        val validService = Service(...)
        val mockRepo = mockk<ServiceRepository>()
        coEvery { mockRepo.createService(any()) } returns Result.Success(validService)
        
        // When
        val useCase = CreateServiceUseCase(mockRepo)
        val result = useCase(validService)
        
        // Then
        assertTrue(result is Result.Success)
        assertEquals(validService, result.data)
    }
}
```

---

#### UI Testing
**Framework**: Compose Testing + Espresso

**Coverage Target**: Critical user flows

    }
    
    // Enter valid university email
    composeTestRule.onNodeWithTag("emailField")
        .performTextInput("test@must.ac.ke")
    
    // Enter password
    composeTestRule.onNodeWithTag("passwordField")

    // Click sign up button
    composeTestRule.onNodeWithText("Sign Up")
        .performClick()
    
    // Verify navigation to profile setup

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

### 8.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Low Initial Adoption** | High | High | 🔴 Critical | Launch providers first; seed with 20+ listings before marketing to customers |
| **WhatsApp Preference** | High | Medium | 🟡 Medium | Emphasize unique features: organized chats, no number sharing, reputation |
| **Firebase Costs at Scale** | Medium | High | 🟡 Medium | Offline caching, pagination, image compression; set budget alerts |
| **AI Matching Inaccuracy** | Medium | Medium | 🟡 Medium | Fallback to keyword search; refine prompts; collect feedback to improve |
| **Safety/Harassment** | Medium | High | 🔴 Critical | Block/report features, content moderation, student verification required |
| **Play Store Rejection** | Low | High | 🟡 Medium | Follow Play policies, prepare privacy policy, test content rating |
| **Scope Creep** | High | Medium | 🟡 Medium | Strict sprint scope, MVP-first mentality, defer Phase 2+ features |
| **Solo Dev Bottleneck** | Medium | High | 🟡 Medium | Modular architecture, 1 rest day/week, ask for help when stuck > 2 hours |
| **Poor Campus Internet** | Medium | Medium | 🟢 Low | Offline-first: Room caching, queue messages, compress images |
| **Data Privacy Concerns** | Low | High | 🔴 Critical | Firebase Security Rules, encryption, transparent privacy policy |

### 8.2 Detailed Risk Mitigation

#### 🔴 Low Initial Adoption
**Risk**: Students continue using WhatsApp groups instead of adopting HustleHub

**Mitigation**:
1. **Provider-First Launch**:
   - Recruit 20 providers manually before public launch
   - Offer them a "free professional portfolio" pitch
   - Help them set up profiles with quality photos
2. **Campus Marketing**:
   - Posters in strategic locations (hostels, cafeteria, library)
   - Social media campaign (Instagram, Twitter, campus groups)
   - Word-of-mouth incentives (referral badges)
3. **Demonstration Events**:
   - Live demos during campus events
   - Partner with entrepreneurship clubs
4. **Value Proposition Clarity**:
   - Clear onboarding explaining benefits over WhatsApp
   - Show success stories from early adopters

---

#### 🔴 Safety & Harassment
**Risk**: Users experience harassment, scams, or unsafe interactions

**Mitigation**:
1. **Student Verification**:
   - Mandatory @must.ac.ke email verification
   - Profile photo review (optional manual approval)
2. **In-App Safety Features**:
   - Block user (prevents all contact)
   - Report user/content (flags for admin review)
   - Message history saved for disputes
3. **Content Moderation**:
   - Automated filters for offensive language
   - Manual review of reported content within 24 hours
4. **Safety Education**:
   - In-app safety tips during onboarding
   - "Meet in public places" reminders
   - Link to campus security contacts
5. **Emergency Response**:
   - Escalation process for serious threats
   - Cooperation with campus security when needed

---

#### 🟡 Firebase Costs at Scale
**Risk**: Firebase usage costs exceed budget as user base grows

**Current Estimate** (500 users, 60% MAU):
- Firestore: ~50K reads/day = $0.18/day = $5.40/month
- Realtime DB: ~200K operations/day = $3/month
- Storage: 10GB = $0.25/month
- FCM: Free up to 10M messages/month
- **Total**: ~$9/month at 500 users

**At 5,000 users** (10x scale):
- Estimated: ~$90-120/month

**Mitigation**:
1. **Aggressive Caching**:
   - Room for offline-first architecture
   - Cache services for 24 hours
   - Cache messages indefinitely
2. **Pagination**:
   - Load 20 services at a time, not all
   - Lazy load chat history (50 messages per fetch)
3. **Image Optimization**:
   - Compress images to < 500KB before upload
   - Generate thumbnails server-side
4. **Query Optimization**:
   - Use composite indexes
   - Minimize real-time listeners (chat only)
5. **Budget Alerts**:
   - Set Firebase budget alert at $50/month
   - Monitor dashboard weekly
6. **Monetization Plan** (Phase 2):
   - Featured listings for providers ($1-2/week)
   - Commission on in-app payments (5%)

---

#### 🟡 AI Matching Inaccuracy
**Risk**: Gemini API returns poor/irrelevant search results

**Mitigation**:
1. **Hybrid Search**:
   - Fallback to keyword search if AI confidence < 70%
   - Show both AI and keyword results
2. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Iteratively refine prompts based on user feedback
   - Use few-shot examples in prompt
3. **User Feedback Loop**:
   - "Was this helpful?" on search results
   - Learn from thumbs up/down
4. **Manual Curation**:
   - Admin can boost/demote certain results
   - Blacklist inappropriate matches
